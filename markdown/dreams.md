# have you died in your dreams?

this incident probably took place in the last 1-2 years from the date when i'm writing this. usually, when a person dies in a dream, they wake up with a shock. that's happened to me as well. but this one dream was kind of different

so it was a regular night, i was sleeping. and like many dreams that the brain shows us, i was falling off a cliff and was going to die, clearly. usually, when something like this happens, a person wakes up with a shock. but i remember that when i was going to die, i was remembering god. although i'm not that religious, i did. and instead of suddenly waking up, i somehow continued into another dream where i was walking up the stairs of a temple in the hills or mountains that i can still clearly picture that view

when i woke up normally, i remembered the part i just described. it's kind of fascinating to me how I didn't wake up. not saying i'm god's chosen because I have also woken up with a shock while dying in dreams. but this was kind of unique to me, and i decided to write this down so as not to forget it, although i probably won't forget this ever... but yeah, just wrote ts
